# ServiceCancellationPredictorApp
 Service cancellation is simply when customers leave doing business with an entity. It involves determining the possibility of customers stopping doing business with an entity. In other words, if a consumer has purchased a subscription to a particular service, we must determine the likelihood that the customer would leave or cancel the membership. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. For many businesses, the ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of canceling service, while there is still time to do something about it. Whereas the company will try to offer some extra functionalities for not leaving the service.
